Here is a sample NestJS project that is using a microservices architecture.In order to create mvp faster this project is built as Monorepo.
I decided to expose the .env file so it can be run easier without any extra explainations to it.
To start the project simply go with 
 - docker-compose up --build
After what you'll be able to work with this project's API directly from your machine on port specified in .env file. 
Good luck!
